## 💫About Me

I am currently a second-year M.S.E. student at [TJ-IP Lab](https://github.com/TJ-IPLab/) of [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) and advised by [Prof. Lu Xiong](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/info/1146/6330.htm). Before this, I obtained the bachelor’s degree in Vehicle Engineering at Tongji University.

My research interests mainly focus on 3D Computer Vision, including Diffusion Models, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and Autonomous Driving. More recently, I have been exploring Multi-modal Large Models and Embodied AI.
